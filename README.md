# NeuralNetwork
Various neural network implementations based on PyTorch.
## Environment
The code is developed using Python 3.6 on Windows 10. NVIDIA GPUs are needed. The code is developed and tested using NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1060.
## Requirement
```
torch == 1.1.0
torchvision == 0.3.0
CUDA == 9.0
cuDNN == 7.0
Pillow == 6.0.0
```
## Dataset
[The CIFAR-10 dataset](http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html) is used in this repository. It consists of 60000 32*32 colour images in 10 classes. There are 50000 training images and 10000 test images.
